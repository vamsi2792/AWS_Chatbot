# Amazon Lex Chatbot

🚀 Here's how I used Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda to create a smart banking chatbot, BankerBot! 🤖

🔍 In this project, I learned how to:
✅ Craft a chatbot from scratch using Amazon Lex.
✅ Integrate Amazon Lambda for real-time data processing.
✅ Design fallback intents to manage unclear user requests efficiently.
✅ Employ custom slot types for precise user input handling.

🌟 The project's highlight for me was watching the chatbot intelligently handle balance inquiries and transfers, even through voice commands!

📢 If you're in the AWS space or love cloud engineering projects too, let's connect! I’m always up for chatting about where this industry is heading, and the cool things we can build in the cloud.
